bothering me so here goes.. bout a month ago i was with a friend and her son, we were hanging out at a camp ground by Allamuchy state park, in Warren county NJ. i think the camp ground was part of Stephens state park either way it was on the Musconetcong river. it was late in the day and we were just walking on the trials by the river. we figured since her son was gonna stay with her folks that evening we would come back later and spend the night at the camp ground. we went home and got together some gear, just sleeping bags and sleeping pads. we stopped at a store got some hotdogs and rolls and a gallon of water then headed to the camp site. it was about 10pm when we got to the camp site and i think we took spot 19. it was close to the road one of the last spots before ya hit the road maybe 50 yards or so. we made a fire in the metal fire ring and just sat around till about 1am, there were maybe 5 or 6 sites that were camped that night one was taken by some boy scouts. at about 1am my friend got in her sleeping bag next to the fire, i was still up drinking hot chocolate and stareing into the fire, about 20min or so later i got into my bag next to her and was lieing on my side looking into the woods. i wasnt comfortable and i laid awake for a good hour or so just thinking and listening to the sounds of the woods and the river that was 100yards tops away from me. then i heard a sound like someone was lightly banging a fork or something against a plate. i thought maybe a bear was snooping around looking for a free meal, this is bear country and we have a very healthy black bear population, but maybe 30 seconds after i heard the metalic sound i heard someone or something bang a branch against a tree 4 or 5 times in a row, i thought that the bear maybe was getting a little to close to someones camp site. then i again heard banging against a tree but this time it was a bout 100yards into the woods and not near any camping area that i had seen in the daylight. then the tree banging came from the first spot as if answering the other position. the first tree banger was what seemed to be on or near the road by the middle of the camp ground. that kinda made my mind wander i was wondering what was going on..and who is up making all this noise. about 10minutes later i looked into the woods which were slightly iluminated by my dieing fire and i saw what looked like a bear looking into my camp about 20 feet away from behind a tree. i saw just the shadowy outline of it. i could see its head and shoulders slowly move out from behind the tree look in and then move back behind the tree. ive seen bears do this before in the day light but never this close. then i closed my eyes waited a few seconds and opened them just to make sure i wasnt seeing things. but this whatever it was had difined shoulders and a rounded kinda pointy on top head, it didnt have and ears like you would see on a bear, nor the flat head of a bear and if it was a bear its front arms wouldnt have given it the squared off shoulders that i was seeing in the silloette of this figure. i got kinda scared for a few moments and didnt move a at all. i thought for a second about jumping up and yelling at it but i didnt want so get it mad at me or scare it. i closed my eyes and tried my hardest just to fall asleep. i dozed off finally and was awoken by my friend who was yelling at me for not putting the bag of hotdogs in the car before going to sleep. we had in the bag a apple and a orange, rolls and a unopend pack of hotdogs, i tied the bag with a simple knot like you would tigh your shoes the night before, but when i got up the only thing left where the bag was, was the orange just sitting there on the ground. my friend said somthing along the lines of wow a bear came and stole our hotdogs. i kinda was wondering what was going on so i decided to have a look around where i saw the figure the night before, i remembered that the shadowy figure was hiding behind the tree and i could see a branch just above its head maybe a foot or so higher than the top of the figure. it was puzzleing because that branch must have been 8 or 9 feet off the ground and black bears where i come from dont stand that tall on there hind feet. i didnt try to tell her what i heard or saw the night before because she wouldnt have belived me anyway, but ive spend lots of time in the back country and woods hunting, fishing, rock climbing, and backpacking. i know what bears look like up close as well as from a distance. and this wasnt a bear and to tall for a person. i didnt smell anything but i think i was up wind anyway and we were burning wood in the fire and all i could really smell was the fire anyway. the thing that really bothers me is the tree banging its was allmost like something was comunicating with something else. it also bothers me that something waited until it was sure that i was asleep before coming into camp. in which case it woulda been 6 or 7 feet from where we were sleeping in order to open the bag and have a look in it, then disguard the orange and take the rest bag and all. it wouldve had to make some sound if it just tore the bag opened. i looked around before we left to see if i could find any tracks or anything but the ground is was just to hard, there was a few game trails but i didnt look very far or spend alot of time looking. i looked on the internet and found this sight and was surprized to see other sitings in new jersey.", "location_details": "the road is off us rt 80, i dont know the exit number just how to get there if im driving

We were on the Omaha Reservation.  These tribal members say they've had many sightings in the hilly bluff zone extending for miles along the west flank of the Missouri River Basin. Five of us had decided to take a day hike to see a possible \u201cX\u201d structure. As we started up the path it became known that to get to the \u201cX\u201d we\u2019d have to veer off the main path and bushwhack through the weeds. Two people did this while three of us decided to stay on the clearer but muddy path. (I still have never seen this \"X\" but pictures are available.) As we headed up the trail one of my Native American companions said he was hearing movement in the woods to our right. At this point we could not see very far off the path as trees and brush blocked the view. I did not hear the movement. We continued forward and came to an area where trees had been cut down in the past. We could see maybe 40-50 yards back into the forest. Two of us looked to our right as soon as we made it to this clearer area and immediately saw movement. I saw a long light brown object that was swinging downward from a horizontal position toward. It was not indicative of any other animal that I can think of and was bent slightly at an apparent elbow. I could not see a hand because of the brush. At the time of the sighting the other witness started telling us what HE just saw. He said \u201cI just saw one\u201d and described seeing the whole upper body of a light brown Sasquatch. Apparently when it noticed us it started to drop down and move to its right (our left) behind cover. He said as it was ducking down the arm had swung way up in the air and back down, and he demonstrated. His description and demonstration exactly matched what I had seen. He did not know that I had also seen it as he was telling me his story. I took a picture of the area where the sighting happened. This subject was behind and to the right of a stick pointing upward. On July 27th 2018, I revisited the location with BFRO investigator T. Bell and hacked my way back into this spot.

Mitchell in a four-wheel drive vehicle. Mt. Mitchell is the highest peak east of the Mississippi River at 6,684 feet, and as a result, the mountain gets heavy snowfalls well into March and sometimes April. There had been some heavy snowfall in the weeks preceding our drive, and there were some deep snowdrifts piled up alongside the road, although the road had only a dusting of light snow on its surface. Almost no one goes up on the mountain in the wintertime, and as I remember it, we had to skirt our way around a barricade to even get on the road to the summit. We reached the top of the mountain, then turned around to drive back down. About a half mile below the summit, we went around a sharp, left-hand turn, and our headlights hit the steep bank beside the road. In the snow on the bank we could see several deep impressions that led up the bank and into the woods. We got out and examined the marks, but it was dark and we couldn't tell much about them. The next day, we drove back up and looked at the marks in the daylight. The tracks, as we took them to be, were in deep snow, and we could see mud at the bottom of them and measured the depth of the snow at 18 inches.  In the two tracks closest the road, there were faint outlines that could have been toe marks, but there were no claw marks visible as with bear tracks. The prints were apparently made by a bipedal animal, and led up a steep bank and disappeared over the top of the bank about 75 yards up the slope.  The bank beside the road was extremely steep, and it took my friend, who is 6-2 and athletic, eight long strides to climb the bank, but whatever left the prints needed only two steps. At one point, the animal had stepped over a fallen branch approximately three feet off the ground without breaking stride. I know sometimes big cats can leave footprints that appear to be two-legged, and there are still some panthers (mountain lions) left in the mountains of North Carolina, but if a cat made these marks it would have to have been the biggest panther in the world. They were about 14 inches long and seven inches wide. We thought perhaps the marks could have been made by clumps of snow falling from trees, but there were marks where there were no overhanging branches. We split up that day and two different groups walked along the road about a mile in each direction from the prints, but we never found where the animal had crossed the road, which means it was obviously using the road for traveling instead of trudging through the deep snow.", "location_details": "Yancey County, North Carolina, near the summit of Mt.

Me, my husband at the time, and my two brothers hiked into Lilly Pad and Crater Lakes, Stillwater County, Montana.  It borders Custer National Forest, north of the East Fork of Fiddler Creek. There were no other cars in the parking lot so absolutely there was no one else up in that area or encountered.  It is a very remote and high mountainous area.  Lilly Pad is full of lilly pads, per its name.  At the time I thought it strange that we didn't see any moose there. When we left Lilly Pad, we climbed the side of the mountain, a very rocky narrow trail (just a game trail) towards Crater Lake.  Near the top, I kept hearing tree branches break, and thought, huh, the forest sure is noisy.  At the top we stepped into an open plateau (in looking at a current Google map, this area is now forested with trees) . We hadn't gone far when I heard a very loud tree knock coming from the upper end of the  plateau, on the side of the mountain. I could pinpoint exactly where the sound came from. It was NOT a tree branch falling. It was a wood knock, obviously wood on wood, a very sharp cracking sound, kind of like a baseball bat hitting a ball only LOUD. I said, \"What in the world was that?\"  One of my bro's said \"loggers\".  Wrong, there was no one up in there and there was no evidence of logging.  Almost immediately following that knock I got the feeling we weren't alone. We crossed the plateau and at the end there was a slight curve taking us to the lake. This area was also open but more of a corridor, maybe 100' or less wide. We fished the SE end of the lake and then one by one started making our way up and around the lake on the south side.  When I got towards the upper end there was a horrible stench and my hair literally started to crawl.  I remember being surprised at the smell. Being close to Yellowstone Park I would have expected a sulphur smell but this was not that; it was a stench like I've never smelled before or since. There was an open area around the lake, maybe 30-50' or so and then heavy brush.   I hurried up and around the lake back to where the guys were.  My older bro and husband would not go back up around, my younger bro started a second trip.  I had no inclination or want to go back around but then convinced myself if he is going, I must have imagined the feeling.  So I started another round.  Got up there and same thing, the stench made me want to gag (it seemed stronger the second time around) and my hair was standing on end.  I would cast and try to glance behind me to see what was there.  And then pine cones started landing next to me!  I would hear a rustle, and a pine cone would land next to me. These were NOT falling off the trees. The trees were too far away and these were coming in sideways and consistently landing right next to me.  My hair was really crawling. I was terrified.  But I didn't want to go back towards the guys, it was shorter if I continued around the end and that would put more space between me and it, whatever it was.  I pretended to keep fishing, and glancing over my shoulders afraid if I confronted it, it would attack.  And I kept glancing at the ground for tracks to see if I could figure out what it was.  At first I thought, oh it's too trampled to tell, and it was, right at the lake edge.  But when I looked towards the bushes and trees right at that upper end, there were 2 sets of huge tracks, one set coming, one evidently going back towards the trees.   The grass there was probably 8-12\" tall and it was smashed down where the footprints were.  I didn't see the actual foot imprints as in mud, just smashed down grass.  Had I not been so terrified I would have looked for toe prints etc but I was taking fast looks.  And of course expecting tracks like a moose or something, not what I saw. At that point I seriously sped up and went around the lake. On the other side there was a place where the lake indented into the trees a bit. I seriously thought about trying to wade across it but it was too deep and I can't swim, as I did NOT want to go into those trees.  Got back to the guys and they were grabbing their stuff and in a hurry to leave.  I said my skin is crawling up there, my younger bro said, yes there's something up there.  We headed out and I knew something was watching us.  It shadowed us until we got back off that plateau. I knew as soon as we hit that rocky trail it wasn't following us anymore. Thru the years I have searched my brain as to what it could have been and nothing fit:  grizzly would have been on us, black bear would have either came at us or run, moose wouldn't smell, mountain lion would watch us but you wouldn't know it was there and also wouldn't smell.  Quite frankly there wasn't an animal that would break tree branches, do a wood knock, or toss pine cones.  Once the bigfoot shows started airing and I heard the eyewitness accounts, I realized what it was.  There simply is no other explanation. I believe there were at least 2 of them, the one breaking the branches and may then have went ahead of us and did the tree knock, possibly to warn a second one that was messing around at the water's edge. My older bro does not remember that trip, my younger bro barely remembers going there. I'm divorced from that husband so who knows what he remembers. I wish I had had the courage to stand and stare at those bushes longer and even walk towards them, I believe it would have stood up. Incidentally there is a recent report with pictures on the BFRO website about a sighting near Red Lodge, Montana, which is relatively close to the area of my encounter.  And somewhere I saw a report of encounters around a \"small town in Carbon County\", a lady and her small daughter would regularly be visited by a family of bigfoots.  The little girl said the small ones don't smell, just the big ones.  I can't find that report again but would really be interested if that is close to where I had my encounter.", "location_details": "To get there take Highway 78 south out of Absarokee about 2.5 miles and turn right (west) onto the road to Fishtail.

So this last Saturday at about 12:30 my hunting partner and I went to Smittle cave conservation area to scout and see what conservation has cleared. We crossed a creek bottom to where there are small food plots. Once we crossed to the other side of the field we saw something on the trail about 150 to 200 yards off. even from that distance I could see it was big. I noted a head by a limb that I judged was maybe 5 or six feet of the ground. what we saw then crouched and sort of swayed a few times before taking off to the right and stopping. not being sure what we saw we crossed into the next field and discussed what it was, we turned around and went back to the field we had seen the creature and it was gone.

I had sat down for a couple of hours and was awaiting the time my friend and I call \"Crunch Time\". That is the time when the wind usually calms down and Deer start to move.Off to my left I could hear what sounded like an animal moving very quietly.I'd like to add that where I sat there was a small hill between me and the spot where I had hoped to ambush a Deer.This animal kept quietly rustling about and I moved from a sitting position to a crouch, getting ready for a shot.All of a sudden a very large tree started to shake violently and whatever this animal was let out a roar/scream that scared the hell out of me.I could see up into the tree and saw nothing in the tree. I could not see the bottom of the tree as it was obscured by the small hill. I immediately got up and ran all the way back to the truck.When I arrived at the truck two DNR officers were waiting to probably check our licenses.One of the officers was a male the other a female.The officers questioned me why I was running.

About an hour or so after camping I could hear movement near the tent but was not too concerned because there is a lot of wildlife in the barrens.The movement got closer and there was this really pungent order.I thought \"uh-oh it's a bear\"but was still not concerned as black bears are mostly just curious and usually will not bother you. I should add here that I have spent a lot of time in the woods as my mother and father were both Maine guides and the woods was my life.I have heard all the noises that wildlife makes in different seasons.I consider myself a good tracker and know the habits etc. of most animals. Then it happened:Whatever it was let out a scream that made every hair on my body stand striaght out and nearly gave me a heart attack.I am saying to myself\"this is no bear.\"Now the girlfriend is awake and in hysterics.I am trying to quiet her so I can keep track of whatever it is.It moved close enough to the tent so I could actually feel it's movement through the ground and hear it breathing.This activity went on for about 20 minutes and it went away.

I told a few folks about this over the years and they think I was nuts. But doesn't matter what they think. I was close enough to know what it was. I would say about less than 50 ft. Right in the middle of a fire road. In December 1977, my dad, uncle and my dad's other friends and myself went up to the cabin owned by a hunters club in Gardner, Mass. We went to spend the night, cook food and my dad and his friends like to play cards after eating supper. Myself and a friend used the snowmobile with a sled attached to the back, we took turns driving the ski doo around and the other would stand on the foot rest on the sled. The area was in northern central Massachusetts, very close to New Hampshire boarder. The cabin is in Ashburnham Mass. It's about 2.5 miles up a fire road called Old Colony Road. I remember it was a snowy winter that year. The area where we saw this thing was right on the edge of a swamp, old train tracks run right thru the area and crosses the fire road that we used to get to the cabin. It was about 4 p.m. or so, it was just getting a little dark. My friend and I left the cabin with the snowmobile, he was driving first and I was on the foot rest on the sled. We left and came up to the swamp, crossed over the tracks and headed down the road about 50 ft or so. It was getting a little late and we decided to not go to far so we turned the sled around on the road. Had to pick it up because of the narrowness of the road. Once we turned it around it was my turn to drive. So now were facing the tracks and the swamp is on both sides of the road. the road goes right thru the swamp and the tracks cross right by the edge of the swamp. At this point I looked behind me to see if my friend was on the sled and holding on, when I looked up I saw this creature walking on 2 legs like a human. He crossed right by the tracks at the edge of the swamp and crossed the road right in front of us. I remember it looking at us and I remember the arms swing clearly. Just like the pictures I have seen from your site. Very similar. Anyway, I remember the its size, that's what was scarey, so large, I'd say about 7to 9 ft high, weight about 400 to 500 pounds. At least for something that size it would most likely be heavy. I know the woods there well. I've spent years in the military and hunt every year. I have been trained in tracking and survival in the woods so I know what I am saying and what I saw. But the thing took about 2 steps and he was across the road. All black hair, didn't notice any smells, but I can tell you this. I won't forget that day ever. It was cold anyway and with no breeze the smell of it wouldn't travel far. My friend was shocked. He won't even mention it when I see him these days. He told one person and they treated him like he was on drugs. So thats why I never wanted to tell to many people. I wanted to say something about it now because I just say a program on TV the other night about bigfoot and the Kiamichi Mountians, I think in Oklahoma or somewhere out there. I remember one other thing that might be relevant. That being noises I have been hearing over the years in the woods there. Something like a crying sound but so load it almost seemed as if it were close by. I think it was a ways away because when we heard the sounds it was late, about midnight. We sit by the fireplace outside the cabin sometimes late cooking steak or deer meat on the grill. Behind the cabin is a huge swamp area that goes up to Route 12 in Ashburnham, Mass. The swamp is down a bit behind the cabin. We find moose droppings back there and lots of tree scraps from deer. I beleive there passing thru that area at times. Those sounds I heard were never heard there before and I don't hear them now when I go up there. Every now and then they seem to come back, but only when were outside sitting by the fire. Strange indeed. These woods go far as well and you could easily travel them and end up in New Hampshire or further without seeing a house. As time goes by and the more I read about what other folks saw and the similarities between each story I'm more wanting to do some of my own investigating, but its very scary out there at night, especially for me. I carry a loaded .44 when I'm up there just because I have seen this thing up close enough to know what it was.

I have been hunting and fishing since I was very young. On June 28th my wife and I decieded to take a walk in the woods. We were heading to a secluded resivior located aprox. 2 miles in the woods. We came upon a spot in the woods that seemed liked someone was watching us. We heard a noise come from some bushes. I thought it was a grunt from a buck. We both expected to a deer come outof the brush. I said, maybe it was a Bigfoot. She told me to shut up and keep walking. We walked for another 15 minutes and realized we were on the wrong path to the lake. We stopped, ate lunch and headed back into the woods. We had stopped at some power lines and sat in some shade. It was over 94 gegrees that day, and this was about noon time. As we walked back, we both noticed some very DEEP foot prints that did not look right. They were clearly 5 toed \"Human\" prints. In between the prints, was some deer tracks. The tracks clearly looked like the Human prints were chasing the deer prints. We both looked at each other and said, why would someone be running Barefoot, in 100 degree weather in the middle of the woods on a Tuesady afternoon? There were no other people in the woods at that time. The tracks were not there the first time we passed this spot, the noise was, the tracks were not. At this point I became very concerned that what ever made the prints was still in the area. I grabbed a big rock and told my wife to take some pictures with her cell phone.

The night started out normal my ex and I departed for a night of coon hunting. We released the old black and tan hound about a mile from where the encounter happened on a large creek bottom of Fletcher creek just north of eight road where the creek crosses the road this was  around 9 o clock pm . The dog took off across the thick creek bottom headed west then north crossing an open meadow and some pine trees before striking the coons sent and quickly treeing the coon on the edge of a large swamp in a big white pine everything normal so far. we didn\u2019t have a gun with us that night so we quickly loaded up the dog and took off to tree another. We released the dog again where the road  (possibly 5 or 5and a half road)intersects a old beaver pond where she promptly struck a scent and made a long arching track north then east then south east covering a few miles of the dense forest quickly. I soon realized the dog had struck a bear or bobcat track as she had chased and treed both (in the area and never chased trash deer coyote etc..) and was covering ground quickly in a circle so we decided to intercept the dog on the next trail by the time(around 10 thirty) we got ahead of the dog she had treed whatever she was chasing about a mile south of the road( I don\u2019t know the name of it there is a hunting pen and an oil well on the end of it) so we set off unarmed with two lights nearly dead after about a half mile whatever she was chasing took off again this time easterly assuming it was a bobcat I shut the lights off and stood silently (a bobcat will jump tree and run if it sees a light coming) the dog promptly treed or/bayed the animal it was chasing again about a mile away we headed that way using the lights sparingly again the animal ran after repeating this another two or three times we finally closed the gap to about 300 yards when suddenly  the dog went silent and ran straight  to us (without calling she wouldn\u2019t come if I called I never could call her off a trail EVER!) tail between its legs whimpering I thought this was odd because the dog had fought bear coon and bobcat and never backed down or lost I didn\u2019t think much of it I was glad to have her back so we could go so I  just leashed the dog and started back out we were less than disorientated because of the long twisting turning chase and no moon and to make matters worse the lights died and we had no cell service! after about an hour of walking in what I thought was the right direction I began to hear something big trailing slightly behind and to the left me I stopped and asked my friend if she had heard any thing she admitted she had but didn\u2019t want to admit it for fear of me picking on her  we continued and so did the trailing I kept throwing the dim dead light back in the direction of the animal each time the brush would crash and limbs high I don\u2019t know how high but higher than a deer could reach and only a large bear on its hind legs could move or break would react to something fleeing the light before it would die out again after a couple seconds the dog continued its unusual behavior (tail between its legs and skittishness)especially when the animal began circling us we would hear it then it would be silent and a leaf would crunch a head of us I would shine the light in that direction and the sound of heavy pounding feat and big 3 inch around trees would break and shake then the light would go dead The whole time I felt as if something large and intelligent was observing us sizing us up the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and shivers ran down my spine the whole incident lasted an hour or 2 we never saw the animal but heard it circling us and breaking huge limbs trees 2 to 3 inches were being broken within fifty feet of us and less and we never saw the animal just the vegetation around it broken or moving after it fled our light for a brief moment before the light would die. It was almost as if it were deliberately breaking trees to intimidate us or that is what it felt like.

I assumed it was a bear but there was no \u201cwoofing\u201d or jaw \u201cpopping\u201d both of which I have heard before and I don\u2019t believe the dog would have backed down after treeing and chasing a few already I don\u2019t know if this was a big foot or not it is near some of the other sightings on your web page (I had no idea there were big foot sightings in Michigan) so I figured I would share my story  I\u2019m not a big foot believer I believe in the possibility but I\u2019m still skeptical.

On the first of the two nights we were there, we heard wierd yells going through the woods right after dark.

As with most classes, some students walked faster than others. I was with the stragglers, a few of whom were suffering from the cold and thin air. The trail had only been opened, as I recall, the previous day, and ours was the first group of the season to make the ascent. Lots of snow remained in shaded areas and in many places on the trail, and it was obvious no one had walked ahead of us, although a couple of older men on four wheelers passed us at one point. We were getting fairly close, within a half mile or so, to the lake; the slope was very steep. I remember our little group went past a switchback and we were uphill from a stream. Somewhere in this stretch, crossing the trail at a right angle, was a series of very large, apparently bipedal, tracks. In shape and contour, the tracks appeared human. No details, such as toe impressions, remained or could be readily detected, but every indication was that the tracks had been made by bare feet, not boots. The students immediately starting exclaiming, \u201cBigfoot, bigfoot!\u201d Doing my best to downplay the tracks, I told the students that they were probably those of a hiker and that they had become enlarged as a result of melting and refreezing. Privately, I didn\u2019t believe that story for a second. As far as I was concerned, the impressions were the record of something extremely unusual. The tracks were huge, at least sixteen inches or more in length and quite wide. The depth of the tracks in the snow and soil was far beyond what I could duplicate; it was obvious, even to the students, that whatever or whoever made the tracks had immense weight (I told them the \u201chiker\u201d was probably carrying a very heavy pack). The distance between the tracks was on the order of four feet or more, an interval that was all the more impressive considering the extreme steepness of the mountain in that area. It did not seem possible to me for any human to duplicate such a feat (so to speak) as was performed by the mysterious maker of those tracks, especially considering the conditions of snow and slope. In addition, the tracks were not headed to Middle Fork Lake. Of course, that doesn\u2019t prove anything, but I found it strange that anyone would hike up the mountain, avoiding the trail, and heading to something besides the lake. As best as I could determine, the tracks appeared to be going in the direction of Bull-of-the-Woods Mountain.", "location_details": "We were on the trail to Middle Fork Lake.

The creature was traveling South to North. He stated that he was traveling about 30mph. Mr. E.H. also stated that the creature was brownish-red in color, no facial features were noted as the creature never looked in his direction.The head appeared to look like a humans. The creature crossed the road in about 3-4 steps, and was very fast. He said that the creature looked to be hunched over. The arms were swinging in a pumping like fashion, like a sprinters arms would pump. Mr. E.H. stopped at the area the creature crossed and looked around, no smell or odor was noted, and no tracks were found due to the hardness of the road and ground. Nothing else was noted. This is the second sighting. The 1st was in 1976 on a pipeline by Mr. E.H. and his wife. The creature in this sighting was also a brownish color and was seen crossing a pipeline.This is in the same area as the 2nd sighting. This area appears to be an active area. Unknown vocalizations also occur at this area. Mr. E.H. has lived and hunted in this area for 40+ yrs and has never heard the vocalizations being heard before. He lives approx. 5-7 miles into the woods. During my visit on 4-5-2000 (Wednesday) myself, Mr. E.H. and his son found a 12\" track near his home. We were on 4-wheelers traveling to an area near a previous sighting by a family member. We came to a large puddle in the 4-wheeler trail and were trying to negotiate around it when he asked me to come look at something. What I found was a 12\" track that was no more then a few days old. The track had some wear due to the rain from Sunday night through Monday late afternoon. We were approximately 1/2 - 3/4 of a mile into the woods. I sent his son to get my plaster box from the back of my truck as I had no where to carry it in. After looking around I found another track about 10 yards from the other but in a very wet and flooding area. I photographed this track as it was impossible to cast. No other tracks were found. After his son returned I measured the track and found it to be 12\" inches in length, and was 3/4 to 1 inch into the ground. Mr.E.H. tried to make a track in the ground nearby but was unsuccessful ( he weighes over 200Lbs). It was unclear how many toes were present due to the mud and leaves in the track. Several photos were made of the track before plaster was poured into it. Due to prior obligations I was forced to leave the cast till Friday 4-7 when I could return. Mr. E.H. and myself secured the area as best we could. I returned on Friday around 10:30 am with my brother Shane.The 2 of us along with Mr.E.H. returned to the spot to retrieve the track cast. We retrieved the cast with no problems. We looked around the area and found what appeared to be Pine saplings that had been bitten and picked at to retrieve termites that were in the trees. We found approx. 8 -10 of these ranging from 3ft to 7ft off the ground. We also found a tree about 3 inches in diameter that had been twisted at the base and broke over. Photos were taken of these.

Had been in the blind since 5:00 am, waiting for dawn. As there were no ducks landing in the pond we had chosen for our blind, my friend and I decided to do some exploring of the surrounding bayous and overflow into the cypress forest swamps. We were in a 14 foot flat bottom boat with a three horse power outboard motor. There was a low, misty fog (not thick) on the water, the sky was entering the dawn's twiligt as there was a reddish peach tint at the horizon and the sky was light (not yet daylight). As we were traveling on the water at a low speed to avoid cypress knees, stumps and floating debris, we noticed a large object directly in our path. It was about 30 yards in front of the boat. At first it appeared to be stationary, until we realized it was moving toward us. As we got closer, our first impression was that it was a man with long grayish brown hair and long beard (a lot of hair on face). We shouted out, thinking perhaps the person had capsized his boat, as we were in a wide channel of water. There was no reply from the \"person\". As we got closer, we realized that the it was moving with purpose toward us. As we were not able to identify the object as a person through verbal contact, we started questioning ourselves as to whether it was a deer, cow, horse, wolf, coyote, dog, nutria, goose, duck, etc. Nothing fit the visual profile or movement of the \"object\". It appeared to be walking through the water, not swimming. The gait matched that of a man up to his shoulders in water, walking. Shoulders swaying back and forth in a forward motion, not that of a large quadruped swimming and lunging or bobbing up and down as a horse, cow or deer would. I checked the water depth by plungeing a six foot paddle into the water and could barely touch bottom with my arm immersed up to my elbow (an extra 18 inches of length over the paddle). We started to become very scared and aggitated as we could not identify it visually and by this point were exceedingly close (approx 15 yards) and could already discern what apeared to be eye sockets, nose and mouth behind a long matted hair. At this point my friend wanted to shoot it with a 12ga shotgun, I stated that I would not shoot what I am not sure of and that if wounded the \"object\" could possibly lunge forward and capsize our boat. At ten yards, I turned the boat around abruptly and gunned the motor. We were both in a panic, and shouting with fear. We left the decoys in the water and went straight back to the boat landing. We were shaking with fear, yet both agreed not to tell any one for fear of being ridiculed and deep inside my self, to protect the \"animal\"! Neither of us wanted to start a \"witch hunt\" by crazed cajun hunters. I am coming forward now, as my memory of the incident has been resurfacing repeatedly in the last month.

Well one night we were sitting in camp listening to the sounds of the night, and watching the ligntning bugs as they floated in the still air. When all of the sudden the woods came alive with screaming, not like any thing I ever heard in my life. I know what panthers, and wild boares sound like, but this was one sound i will never forget. We shined the flash lights out into the direction of the screaming, and what we saw or thought we saw was to say the least some what up setting. My grandfather and my Uncle were raised in this part of the woods, and i had never seen then afraid of any thing, but this was one time that was diffarent. We would have left right then and there, but it had rained earlier in the evening, and the road was to muddy to travel. We had to spend the night, oh and what a night it was. I can't  remember ever being so damn scared in my life. That thing tore the woods up all around us, and it screamed and made some of the wierdest noises i ever heard. I don't think i will ever forget that night, even as I write this, twenty years later, I can still hear it. Well any way, in the early morning hours it finally went deeper into the swamp and out of our area. We waited until first light and with gun in hand we decided to have a look at what ever was there. The small trees were broken about six feet off of the ground. Not totally off, just snapped and shoved down. The grass around them was flattend to the ground and we looked for some king of foot prints. What we found, no one would have ever believed us. They were huge! I have to tell you one thing, I had never heard of big foot or any other kind of wild animal at that time.

I will try to hit on a few here. One night my mother, my grandmother and I heard a loud bang on the back of house which shook the house. When we went to check it out, we saw a large figure pass by the dining room window. This window was rather high off the ground. I was about 10 or 11 at the time and I could not even reach the bottom of this window. But whatever it was covered the entired window from top to bottom and side to side as it passed over it. So it had to be tall and rather large. It was dark in color and appeared to be covered with hair. My grandmother got her gun and we spent most of that night without sleep. On another night, in the early fall, I was in bed with the window open above my bed. My mother was in the bathroom right next to my room in the shower with the window beside her also open. At the same time we heard something walking in the leaves in our yard just outside. She ran from the bathroom to my room. I had heard this thing walking and breaking sticks as it approached. I could also hear it breathing. I had the impression it was quite large from the sound of the breathing which was heavy. It made a slight deep moaning sound as it breathed. I was paralyzed with fear and I could not look out my window, I could not even get out of bed when my mother came to the door and yelled for me to come to her. She made herself come to my bed and grab me out of the bed but she also couldn't bring herself to look out the window. It made the hairs stand up on our necks and we just weren't able to try and look at it. We did not smell anything that night. We could not find footprints from either of these two incidents because of the yard being covered with leaves, however we did find broken sticks where it was apparent something rather heavy had walked in order to break them (we didn't weigh enough to break them, we tried). And we did find footprints on numerous occasions out behind our home down a dirt road that went not even a quarter mile to an oil well. We also discovered hairs on the barbed wire fence. We saved some of these and I believe my parents sent them off to be analyzed, but we never heard anything from it. The hair color did not match any animals in the field nearby. The animals in the field were cows and were black and red in color. This hair was a light brown. It was also about 4 or 5 inches long. This is going to sound a little far-fetched but during the time we lived here we witnessed what we believed was a young sasquatch become mature. It happened over a period of years. We first noticed rather large 4 toed footprints (I have no idea where the 5th toe was) on the dirt road behind the house. It was larger than any man's could be. It had 5 ft. spaces between prints. And one was so heavy that it inprinted in some soft rock in the area. We watched these footprints a lot. No one we showed them to could identify them. However, bear prints were ruled out by the people we showed them to. We saw them all the time there. There was a pond nearby that maybe it was using for water. One day we noticed a smaller set of prints along side the larger ones. We watched over time as these prints got larger and larger with the other ones. Then one day it was just the one set of smaller prints. Those got larger and larger until they reached what appeared to us as grown. Even up to the time we moved from there, we had incidents and saw these prints. We also saw where it looked like something had bedded down under a rotted out tree and had packed the ground with straw. There were tiny piles of bones and feathers there too, not strewn around but arranged neatly in piles. My grandmother heard something in those woods also while hunting that sent her running so fast she lost her footing and tumbled down the hill and skinned herself up. She could not describe the sound to us, she just kept saying it was not like any sound she had ever heard. She had been tracking a buck and listening to it snort in some dense brush when she heard it from the opposite direction. It only yelled once. But that was enough to scare her so badly to cause her to hurt herself getting away and she was in shock when she got back to the others she was hunting with and her face was so white they were afraid she was going to pass out. She won't talk about it now. I will tell one other incident, and quit on that. It happened to my sister (14 at the time), a friend of my sister (also 14 at the time) and myself (11 at the time). We had walked down the dirt road behind our house and had reached just inside the edge of the woods. We starting to smell this awful smell we could not identify. We were talking about this smell when suddenly we heard a grunting/growling noise from the woods beside us. It was not very loud but it was a deep sound that terrified us. We ran immeditely home and did not venture back there alone again. We were even scared when we would go down there with family. We all often walked that road. But we all always felt like we were being watched the whole time. These woods behind our house were connected with a large swampy wooded area called Middlefork Bottom. It was connected to the Kisatchie National Forest. I must also mention that on the occasions this thing visited close to our home, our 2 dogs we had would not bark, as a matter of fact they would leave our house for 3 days at a time and not return until we went to get them from a neighbor's house down the road. If we brought them back sooner than that, they would duck their tails behind them and run away again. I have never seen brave dogs that pitiful looking.

We went to our camping spot that we have gone to for over 20 years and set up camp. This was on Friday night. The next day was uneventful and we were both tired so we went to sleep about 8 PM. Sometime later in the evening, I awoke to very loud screaming and some sort of yelling that I have never heard before in all my years of being in the wilderness. The screaming lasted about 20 to 30 seconds, stopped for about 20 seconds, then started again. This happened 3 times. I finally got my brother-in-law to wake up and he heard about 4 or 5 seconds of the third time. We were both very tired and he fell back asleep in seconds. It was really quiet. You could not hear anything. I could not go back to sleep after that. I laid in my sleeping bag inside the tent for about 30 to 40 minutes with dead silence in the forest. When I was just starting to doze off again, I heard footsteps entering our camp. I heard the footsteps, which were not of a 4 legged animal, walk past my side of the tent. It walked around the entire tent and I saw a shadow on the end of the tent about 5 feet high. With the moon being up in the sky, whatever cast the shadow had to have been taller than 5 feet. It circled the tent and walked by my side again. It stopped at the other end of the tent and scratched the material like it was trying to figure out what the material was. It walked away from the tent after that and went across the gravel road. I could hear the gravel under its feet. After it crossed the road, it went into the woods. After a minute or so, I heard the sound of 2 sticks hitting together about 15 to 20 times. Nothing else happened for the rest of the night. The next morning, we got up and I told my brother-in-law what else had happened during the night. We looked for tracks around the tent, but the ground was covered with a thick layer of leaves and pine needles. We looked on the road , but the road bed is red clay based and very hard. We packed our gear and headed for home.

After about 10-15 mins of us sitting at the top of the hill talking about this we noticed that a few of the cattle looked very anxious and were looking toward the fence row that bordered the swamp area. We all started getting excited that the cows were scared of something, when all of a sudden the herd startled and began running up the hill out of that corner and bottom. Since we were in their path we moved and watched them run back to ward the south end of the field. Being curious we gathered up some weapons (logs,sticks,rocks) and decided to go see what was there, not expecting to see anything. We crossed the bottom and started toward the fence row.We noticed that it was extremely quiet in that corner of the field . We began to look around when we noticed some reddish hair stuck to the barbs on the fence.Then thought hey there are no reddish colored cows,so why is this hair this color and on the top row of 4 row barb wire fence ( fence was 5 ft at the highest point) we then heard something moving in the woods (very thick and dense,lots of thorns)where the hair was at. At this time i noticed that a pine tree roughly 5inches in diameter had been twisted and knocked over about 8-10 feet up.We hadnt had any storms recently and no other trees were damaged. We decided we should leave.As we started to leave my the younger boys threw there stuff down and began running me ,but me and my friend didnt. I then had the feeling that we were being watched,i asked my friend if he felt that as well and he said yeah, i turned toward the fence to see a face about 7ft up standind next to the broken tree,i asked my friend if he saw it as well and said uh huh, we stared at it for about 2 mins before we ran away. What i saw was 2 eyes a gray/white color with reddess hair,the top of the head was hiddien by brush,the bridge of the nose was very apparent,straight,long and narrow the rest was hidden from view. After that we never said anything about it again.About a month later my friend decided he was going back in there to look around with his dog.(this is the same dog that was with us the first time and acted very afraid,and this dog has chased many animal in that field) I wnet to the fence row by the broken tree with him but told him i was not going in there with him and that id wait there for him.He said he'd be back later.After he crossed the fence i lost sight of him about 5ft in. No sooner had i lost sight of him i hear movement to the left of the spot he went in, shortly after this i heard him come running back to the fence row, he was yelling i saw it, i saw it..he jumped that barbed wire fence in stride with his dog hot on his heels. From that day on we never went to that area again. Later on that fall we had found a calf in the swamp that had been ripped open and the guts had been pulled out,but not eaten.We passed it off as wild dogs or coyotes/wolves. Later that winter we had a snow (unusual) and again found another calf that was the same way but in another area of the field. We also passed this off as wild dogs, coyotes/wolves. But since reading about the deer kills in other states,i began to think that these calves had been done the same way.We never talked to anybody about what we saw.Except the calves.

Sighting one occurred on Tuesday August 22, 2000 around 1300hrs.  Mr. Whitstine stated he was operating his cutter, which resembles a skidder in that the only difference basically is one has huge shear type cutters and the other has a holder.  Whitstine was approaching some fallen trees when he saw what appeared at the time to be the rear end of a horse.  Thinking this was a nearby resident's horse, he rattled the cutters in an attempt to scare it away, but as he rattled the cutters the object turned and stood up.  It was at this time he realized that he was not looking at a horse but a large bipedal creature.  He noticed that it was covered from head to toe in thick, long, jet black hair.  The hair around the face was also long and he couldn't make out any facial features.  The creature turned and began to head for a nearby logging road that ran parallel to Flaggon creek.  Whitstine then began to follow in the cutter, and as he got nearer to the creature it turned and jumped into the creek (bayou) and began to try to swim to the other side.  Whitstine stated it looked like it couldn't swim very well as it \"kept bobbing up and down trying to keep its head out of the water, but would occasionally go underwater.\"  After reaching the other side, the creature stopped and looked back then fled into the adjoining woods.  Whitstine called his boss who thought he was joking and brushed it off.  Whitstine also told fellow loggers who also poked fun at him.  Whitstine stated that he got as close as maybe twenty feet. Encounter number two occurred on Thursday August 24, 2000 around 0700-0730hrs while surveying a property line with another logger.

From the side of which we approached the stream we were about five feet above the water and as we approached the stream the three of us immediately spotted two Creatures on the other side of the stream in a crouching posture position drinking water from the stream.  We froze in amazement of what we were looking at, and at the same time the three of us were trembling with fear knowing we were so deep in the woods and quite lost.  We were looking at two Human/Ape like figures whom were completely covered with darkish brown gray hair but the face appeared to be of lighter tone skin. From the head down the two creatures had long hair past their shoulders,with alot of long grayish hair tones, the rest of the body was short hair. They were starring at us and we were starring at them..One was of adult and we could tell it was female and the other was childlike and was of male gender in appearance. They appeared to be just as frightened as we were and after about 30 seconds of this encounter the adult creature turned to the childlike creature and made a motion with it's hand and they turned around from the stream and started running through the woods. There was never a sound made from either one that we could hear. Needless to say when they took off running we did the same in the opposite direction and didn't stop until we were out of the woods.

Finally my father walks thru the door but not empty handed. My father was a avid fisherman and thought that he would surprise his girls with fresh fish. I remembered the wonderful smell that came from that kitchen that night. It got hot so my mother opened the back door. That is when my sister and I had a chance to play, You see we would take turns pushing each other so that we could taking a ride on the screen door. It was a starry night I remembered looking up to take a view of the sky. So I decided to climb up on to the door to take a ride and I looked out to my backyard area where every one would park there cars, and the trash cans would be lineup in a row on the curve in front of cars. About 47-50ft away there was a tree also and remembered it because the leaves would never fall. The light pole was sitting under the tree with it\u2019s bright light that would shine and light up that entire area.

It was a beautiful sight to look upon this 7 1/2ft short red haired, muscular being. My sister and I look at it for about 20 minutes.  I was so happy that Tony had came to visit. but why did he not even turn his head to look at my sister and I. So we continued to look at it what I remember the most was the beautiful red rusty looking hair and its tan face. I only heard the rustling of the garbage the most striking thing that I remember was how long his arm were from the wrist to the hand area the fingers where long that when he was digging in trash he did not have to bent completely over to reach the bottom of the can. So I turned to my mother and said \"Mommy tony the tiger is digging in the trash can. My mother walked up to the door looked out and told us to quickly get away from the door and closed it in a hurry and locked it. It was never mention to my father who was in the next room.

Before I begin I just want it noted that there was NO drinking or the use of drugs. We decided to go to Plum Island. At the time, the refuge was free to enter and the entire road was dirt. That day there was no one in the refuge, as we drove down the road,  I noticed no cars the entire 6.3 miles of the refuge, it was empty, we drove to the end.

I took a look around, but didn\u2019t see anything.  I noticed there was no one in the area.  I saw no birds or waterfowl.  The sounds went on for about 10 minutes or so, I felt uneasy at this point and said we should go. We all got in my car and started back out.

The girls in the back seat didn\u2019t see anything s they were to busy talking to each other. I slowed to almost a stop where what we saw it cross the road, there was solid brush that it went into, we could see where something went through the brush. There was no sign of  it, it was gone. The figure that crossed was huge, 7 feet or more, very wide, all black from head to toe. It was a little hunched forward as it walked upright. I noticed its arms were longer than average and they swung as it walked.  It took only three steps to cross the road. The road is about three cars wide. It had a smooth stride. It did not look in my direction,  just crossed the road and it was gone. I only saw it for about 5 seconds I could never forget the image of it crossing the road. I went back there today, my children wanted to see where I had the sighting.  I didn\u2019t make back up the observation tower because of these flies that nest in the marsh, they are Green Headed Flies, they are, as the woman in the office said, \u201cman eaters\u201d.  They bite hard. As you drive down the road, they follow the car, dozens fly around the car. So the kids didn\u2019t want to get out and get eaten by them and neither did I, so I didn\u2019t get up on the observation tower to take a look.

I had my lights on my small toyota and my windshield washers were on at intermittent speed.  I witnessed what I thought was a man come up from a steep ravine, walk over to the ramp guardrail and step over it in angular fashion.  I thought here comes someone looking to hitchhike this morning.  The \"man\" was tall and his appearance was a drab kind of mushroom color from head to foot.  I thought he was wearing smoked of rain parka or slicker because there wasn't a clear indentation from his head to the top of his shoulders.  As I got closer I realized that this \"suit\" was not material but looked like long wet matted fur/hair/yuck.   The \"man\" proceeded to step into the roadway.  I thought what is this jerk doing trying to commit suicide with my help.  He got several feet into the lane when he turned to face my oncoming car.  He stood there looking perplexed and actually swayed side to side several times as though he didn't know what was coming at him....my car.  All of sudden he startled and turned and ran back to the guardrail.  He bolted over the guard rail and went scurrying down the embankment.  My mouth was agape and I thought \"what in the hell was that!!!\" I was frightened and was too scared to even look over my shoulder or even into the rear view mirror. When I got to work that morning in Silver Spring, Maryland, I was shaking like a leaf.  My co-workers immediately noticed that I was upset.  I called the Laurel police to inquire if there had been any reports of an escaped gorilla in the area.  They thought I was kidding.  I called my fiancee and told him.  Years later there was an article in our local county paper about a man who was writing a book on big foot sightings in the area.  His article spoke of a sighting by two employees of a water treatment plant that was located within 150 yards of my sighting and this sighting had occurred in the Spring of 1976 just like mine.  Also his article said a scientist working at N.A.S.A. had also witnessed a big foot sighting in the same area as he headed for work in Greenbelt, Maryland.  I almost started to cry, all these years and what I had seen had stayed with me was finally being \"vindicated\".  I called the author of the article and related my story to him.  Several days later, though, I got a strange phone call.  The person on the end of the line was a male voice that asked me what the \"frequency was\".  I told him I didn't know what he as talking about, but he was very persistent that I knew the \"frequency\"  I felt that this call was somehow related to the call I had had with the writer of the article several days earlier...maybe coincidence but still I wondered.", "location_details": "Laurel, Maryland.

We had to park on some railroad tracks by the aquaduct and walk through some very dense sticker bushes and overgrowth to find the place. To describe the quarry, it is located in the middle of the woods. It is about 75 yards long and about 30 yards wide with very tall cliffs, about 50 to 80 feet tall in some places. However there are a few places where you can walk down to the waters edge. As we were approaching the quarry, we heard this very loud screeching sound coming from about 25 yards away in the overgrowth. It was very loud and it actually startled us when it first started. The only way to describe the sound would be to say it sounded like a pig getting slaughtered. We stopped walking and waited but it stopped, whatever it was. We continued walking and found the quarry, hearing the strange sound several more times, always coming from a different place. We made a survey and located a place to go down to the waters edge to sit and rest. As we made our way around the quarry we heard the screaming again. Actually coming from the area where we wanted to go! We were not too alarmed though, being curious and stupid. We made it to the waters edge and sat down and started to look around and check the place out. I had picked up a stick off the ground and got out my pocket knife and started to carve on the wood. Suddenly there was a very large splash in the water. It sounded like a person had just jumped in but when I looked up could see ripples in the water where something had gone in. Figuring it was a rock falling from the cliffs we began talking again. About 5 minutes elapsed and we heard another splash. This one bigger and it was very far away from the edge. I asked my freind \"Did you throw something in?\". He said no, he was looking at me. We looked around to see if anyone was there that we didnt see but there was no one anywhere. We sat for about 5 more minutes talking and then heard another big splash. Neither of us saw what made it but the disturbance in the water was so big we guessed it had to be something big! We started to think that someone was in the woods and didnt want us trespassing and was trying to scare us off. However as we started to really think, we became aware there was no way anyone could throw any rock that big, that far. So we made the choice to go ahead and leave. As we were climbing up and out of the quarry another splash came from very near where we had been sitting and also sounded very big. We reached the top and started to make our way to the car. We only walked about 20 feet when something came crashing through the tree branches and hit the ground near us very hard. It sounded like a 20 pound rock hitting the ground. At that point we both stopped walking and turned and really looked hard into the woods. Neither of us saw anything. As we stood there listening, I swear Ive never heard the woods more quite in my life.  We started to walk again and the objects being thrown at us started to get alot more accurate. I remember saying to my freind \"What the hell is going on?\" His response was to tell me GO!!! We took off running and reached our only real obsticle, a creek about 10 feet wide where we had to cross on a log. I went first and he was close behind. As we where halfway across the log something landed in the creek about 5 feet from me that had to be the size of a paint bucket. I didnt see if it was a rock or what but it was big. At that point I jumped for it and hit the ground running with my freind right on my tail, neither of us looking back. I have never really felt scared like that, but that day I had the thought that we might meet something that was beyond nature and not live to tell about it. Our journey into the woods took about 30 minutes due to the high growth of pricker bushes, Our journey out took about 3 minutes! We reached the car and the only after the adrenaline wore off did we realize we both were bleeding nicely from running top speed through summer overgrowth. At the time, I didnt know about the connection between the rocks being thrown at us and the screaming to bigfoot, but it sounds like a classic case.

Myself, my Uncle and a few hunting buddies frequented a 68 acre parcel of land in Street, MD.  One day we were conducting target practice (sighting in our guns) for the upcoming hunting season.  It was a warm, sunny day and off in the distance one of us noticed movement in a wooded area across Broad Creek.  It appeared that there was a large dark silhouette walking back and forth in the foliage.  Every time it walked back and forth it would stop and grab a hold of a large tree and began to shake it.  Keep in mind this was a calm warm day and no other trees were moving because there was no wind.  I thought it was very unusual behavior and must have taken an enormous amount of strength to be able to shake a tree of this size.  I peered through my 4 X rifle scope to examine the object more closely and observed it to walk upright and was covered with dark brownish hair.  Its head was large and I could only observe the upper half of the body.  When it turned, its arms appeared to be long and muscular and I could see that its back was very muscular too and had a \"V\" shape to it, which led me to believe that this was no bear.  It seemed to be agitated that we were there.  After about 15-20 minutes of watching it we decided to leave and never spoke of the incident again. Additional things: In October just after dusk that same year on the same parcel of property my uncle was walking from the the dirt road area through a grassy area down a hill to the barn.  I heard him yell and call out to me.  I came running thinking he had fell down and I observed him on the ground with his tools scattered all over the ground.  I smelled a horrible pungent odor, heard heavy breathing and large foot steps coming from the near by wooded area.  It was dark and I could not see anything and I got an eerie feeling of being watched.  I got my uncle up off the ground and he told me as he was walking down the grassy trail, he heard long loud foot steps coming up from behind him. Thinking it was one of us playing a prank on him, he braced himself for one of us to jump on his back, however whatever hit him from behind knocked him with such force, he feel forward to the ground causing him to drop his tool box.  He said whatever hit him ran into the woods and was grunting and walking back and forth.  We both got flash lights and tried to look in the wooded area where we heard the heavy breathing but did not see anything but heard what sounded like bipedal footsteps go down the large decline and cross the creek at the bottom.

It is an old growth forest. The understory was mostly clear of bushes and brush. I would from time to time camp out overnight there. I always camp with nothing more then a sleeping bag on the ground. While on the refuge I would not light fires, not cook food, not play music; just pure silence, meditation and observation. Late on this one evening in late July, I heard wood knocking or clapping in the distance from the south portion of the river. I instantly thought of Bigfoot (I must be honest, especially after all the activity I had observed throughout the months prior). I had a large stick with me, so I slapped it against an old tree. At first I heard no reply. I repeated the banging once every few minutes until I did got a response of knocking back. This was in the same location as before. It then returned to silence until about 15 minutes later when another knocking occurred. About an hour after the wood knocking I heard definite bi-pedal footsteps walking very slowly. The footsteps were obviously coming from something which was being very cautious. The creature was approaching from the south where the wood knocking sounds were coming from. I assumed that it was on the next island downstream (which is separated by a narrow deep channel of water 15 ft across by 6-10 ft deep). I remained silent the whole time as to not scare it off. The next thing I heard was a loud \"kerplunk\" of something falling or dropping into the water channel.

It sounded as if it were tired of the game or just leaving because it investigated what I was doing. The rest of the night was silent.

The **** was established as a wildlife research refuge in 1936. Prior to 1936, it was a large privately owned family estate (since the 18th century) and partially owned by the defense department in the early 20th century. The refuge area has largely been left untouched and never encroached by development, large scale farming, logging, or citizens. Farming was limited during the 18th century as the family line became very wealthy and used the massive area as a private estate for family members from the 19th century onward. Specific Location: Central Tract (extremely secured, gated and guarded area that is off limits to all citizens that are not employees) This area has been dedicated to bacterial, viral, pesticide, endangered species, natural resources, and migratory bird research for over 50 years. This tract is nationally famous from Rachel Carson's \"Silent Spring\" book and the research which uncovered and revealed the extreme dangers of DDT and other pesticides. There are many old small research buildings trickled throughout the center portion of the tract. Surrounding the core of research buildings there are lots of very rare trees (true Chestnut trees, next to genetically modified Chestnut trees) and endangered plants. Beyond this core to the east are many mitigation research ponds and closed areas which breed endangered birds. The majority of the central tract is dense forests, streams, rivers and ponds.", "county": "Prince George's County", "state": "Maryland", "season": "Summer", "title": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null, "date": null, "number": 50159.0, "classification": "Class B", "geohash": null, "temperature_high": null, "temperature_mid": null, "temperature_low": null, "dew_point": null, "humidity": null, "cloud_cover": null, "moon_phase": null, "precip_intensity": null, "precip_probability": null, "precip_type": null, "pressure": null, "summary": null, "uv_index": null, "visibility": null, "wind_bearing": null, "wind_speed": null, "location": null}, {"observed": "Myself and 2 good friends were camping in the Lill Aaron Strauss Wilderness area of Green Ridge State Park in Allegheny County Maryland. We were all in our late teens but very experienced campers and very comfortable in the woods. On the 2nd night of our trip we made camp in a low area several miles off the trails near where our topographic map showed a Civil War cemetery was located, though we were unable to find the site. After dinner we sat around the fire as the darkness grew and we all began to feel a bit spooked, as if we were being watched, so we let the fire burn itself out and bedded down. Early the next morning I awoke to a loud wailing which I can only describe as a cross between a lion roar and a screech owl. The noise happened several times and it was very close. At the same time we heard something crashing through the vegetation nearby and what sounded like thick branches cracking and heavy thuds as if large logs or rocks were impacting the forest floor. My friend Bryan and I were sleeping in hammocks over which we had suspended rain ponchos. The ponchos were fastened to the hammocks so we would need to untie them in order to get out and we could not see out either. I whispered to Bryan \"what was that?\". He whispered back \"I don't know\". That was all we said. I was scared out of my mind and did not dare even move my head to try to see anything as I didn't want to draw attention to myself. I was able to look at my watch and determine it was just after 5am. At that moment I resigned myself to my fate, figuring that if something out there wanted me I would have no chance. I made my peace and waited, eventually drifting back off to sleep. Bryan did not sleep at all after the episode and our 3rd friend, Tom, somehow slept through the whole thing.

I was approaching the top of the mountain (apx 1200 feet above sea level) when I observed a slight glimps of a moving object about 100 yards ahead of me. October mountain is a heavily wooded area and it was very difficult to see clearly because of all the low brush and scrub. At first all I could see were arms moving and an occassional glimps of a fur covered body. At first I thought I was looking at a large black bear which are not uncommon in the area. I pulled a pair of 40 power biocculars from my travel pack and attempted to focus on the object. Again it was difficult because of all the brush, at one point the animal moved into a slight clearing, it was then that I realized I was observing something very unusual! The animal was very tall (cannot accurately approximate the size) and slightly stooped. Its body was massive and covered completely with reddish hair. I noticed that the head was also very unusual in shape and size. The head was rather pointed and covered with hair or fur. The face was dark in color and had less hair than the top of the head. The neck seemed to be non-existant. At that moment it turned toward me and I was absolutely shocked, it looked very human. At this point I was so frightened, that I took measures to hide myself. After getting over my initial chill I continued to study the animal. It was still in the small clearing and seemed very occupied. It was moving stones and small peices of wood and grubbing for either roots or insects, it was simply to far away for me to see exactly what it was eating. I could see its large arm moving to its mouth every so often. What really took me by suprize was that it was stacking rocks after moving them. One on top of another. This is when I thought perhaps this animal was infact a human, why would it stack rocks in this way? At this point I wanted to get a little closer to see if it was a man in a fur coat or a monkey suit. I checked the wind and made an effort to stay down wind of the animal. I was able to get about 20 yards or so closer to the animal. I found a good observation area and studied the animal closer. At this point I could planly see that this was something very strange indeed, it was not human. The arms were to long and the face seemed very distored and elongated. The arms extended past the nee caps! The hands were very large but human in shape. The fur seemed to be tipped with a lighter color of red. I became so frightened at this point that I began to run back to the trail. I looked back at one point and noticed that the animal had its head back and was slowly moving back into the forest. I don't think it was aware of me, though I wonder how it could have missed hearing me running through the underbrush. I was frightened severly for several weeks and would not hike in that area of the mountain without a hiking partner and a rifle. I will never forget what I saw...never!
